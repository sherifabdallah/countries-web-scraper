The settlement is led by Group Village Headman Chinsapo.

According to some legend in the township,the settlement’s name originates from misspelling and mispronunciation. It is said that the area around Chinsapo had so many pythons and these long snakes are called nsato in Chewa language. Chinsato means a huge python.
So this area was therefore called Chinsato because of the abundant pythons. Out of Chinsato came Chinsapo, perhaps ending the pythonic era.
